**`Tech Composer (fancy way of saying I do coding and relate it to music)`**

I'm a full-stack developer who likes building both effective and beautiful solutions. I like building systems that accomplish their goals and are visually pleasing for their users. All kinds of software have some kind of art in them; it is the work of a composer to make sure all the things on a project work towards the same goal to deliver an outstanding solution.

### My Coding Journey
The first encounter I ever had with code was on 2020, when the pandemic struck my country and we had to lock ourselves in our houses. For two years, I didn't come out of my house and the only thing my family went out was for essential stuff (food, water, y'know). 

During this two years, I took guitar seriously and started practicing to become a professional musician, and in July 2020, I had my first coding experience with C#. I spent 1 month learning and absolutely hated it. 

A year after that I tried once again, this time with python. I learned all the basics of coding and got a taste of OOP, but still didn't find anything useful to do with coding, I just seemend fun.

Another year passed, and thanks to [Emmanuel](https://github.com/l1nk01), I got motivated and wanted to study Data Science at ITLA, but changed my mind when I saw someone doing data science and there was more Excel than anything else. That's when I saw a coding tutorial of someone making an application and I fell in love with what I saw. I started studying Front-end Development and learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript 4 months before entering ITLA, and have been coding ever since.

On ITLA I learning all kinds of things, both thanks to some of the best teachers I've ever had and my own effort (reading documentation endlessly and putting things into practice). I catched an interest on Web Design and 3D Design, Product Design and Digital Art, and then tasted what Back-end Developement really is, and I have to admit I loved it.
`
Nowadays, I consider myself a `Digital/Tech Composer` whose passion is to make things on the Front-end and the Back-end work towards the same goal. You can have all kinds of art working together on the Front-end (3D, Audiovisuals, Interactive...), and all kinds of things working together on the backend (APIs, Databases, Architectures, Microservices...) but all those things must work towards the same goal to have an optimal, pleasing and effective product. That's my motto.

You could also say that it's a fancy way of saying I do coding for a living.
